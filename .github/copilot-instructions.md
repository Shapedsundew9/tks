# Project Guidelines

## Repository Layout

- This is a pure Rust package repository.
- The crate/package project is configured by the repository-root `Cargo.toml`.
- Reusable package code belongs in `src/lib.rs` (and submodules under `src/`).
- Executable entry points belong in `src/main.rs` (or `src/bin/`).
- Integration tests belong in `tests/` and should import the package as `rust_base`.
- Put one-off developer utilities or scripts in `scripts/`.
- Keep build artifacts such as `target/` out of commits unless the repository explicitly tracks them.
- Be explicitly aware that GEMINI.md is a symbolic link to .github/copilot-instructions.md

## Rust Development

- Use the official Cargo toolchain (stable Rust) managed via `rustup`.
- Build and verify the project from the repository root with `cargo check` and `cargo build`.
- Declare runtime and development dependencies in `Cargo.toml`; do not add ad hoc dependency files.
- Keep the supported Rust edition (`2024`), version (`rust-version`), and package metadata in `Cargo.toml` accurate.
- Follow existing code style and public APIs (`cargo fmt`, `cargo clippy`). Avoid unrelated refactors.
- Never hard-code, print, or commit credentials, API keys, tokens, or other secrets.

## Validation

- Run Rust tests with `cargo test`.
- Run linter checks with `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings`.
- Check formatting with `cargo fmt --check`.
- When changing packaging metadata or preparing for release, package the crate with:
  `cargo package`.
- Inspect the generated package archive in `target/package/` when packaging changes affect included files or binaries.
- Run focused checks for the files and behavior changed before running broader validation.
- Keep intentional Markdown exceptions narrow and document them with targeted configuration or inline suppression.

## Dependencies

- Prefer well-established, maintained crates when a dependency is genuinely needed.
- Add every new dependency to the appropriate section of `Cargo.toml` and verify with `cargo check`.
- Avoid introducing a dependency for functionality that is small and clear to implement with the standard library.

## Services Available

- Postgres `$DATABASE_URL`
- Neo4j `$NEO4J_URI`, `$NEO4J_USER`, `$NEO4J_PASSWORD`
- Crates.io `$CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN`
- GitHub `$GITHUB_TOKEN`
- Arc AGI `$ARC_AGI_API`
- Hugging Face `$HF_READ_TOKEN`
- Emergent Mind `$EMERGENT_MIND_BASE_URL`, `$EMERGENT_MIND_OPENAPI_SPEC_URL`, `$EMERGENT_MIND_TOKEN`

## Documentation

- Keep `README.md` aligned with the install, usage, development, and publishing workflows.
- Always run `npx markdownlint-cli2 --fix "**/*.md"` after markdown changes but do not address issues that cannot be fixed without explicit permission.
- Never modify `.markdownlint-cli2.jsonc`. Ask the user first if a change is necessary.
